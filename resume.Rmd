2016 - 2019

#### Tissue Specific Transcriptome of Zebrafish in AChE Mutant Embryos

- I developed a pipeline to analyze tissue specificity (TS) on zebrafish, considering the dynamicity of gene expression, by using specific metrics such as Tau, Tsi. Then I applied the TS analysis on mutant zebrafish embryos by using publicly available datasets. I compared the effect of using different normalization methods on TS discovery as well. I performed qPCRs for in vivo confirmations after isolating the RNAs. I investigated the relationship between ache and the retinal genes by using the tools like Gene Onthology (GO).

#### Role of AChE as a tumor suppressor together with P53

- My role was to dissect, genotype the fish tissues and embed them in OCT. Besides I bred appropriate zebrafish lines for the next steps of the project.

#### Identification of peridodontis disease related genes (collaboration w/Dentistry Department of Ankara University)

- Being a research assistant in this project, I helped the dentistry students to perform both wet lab and bioinformatics analysis.

#### Role of Mineralocorticoid Receptor in Breast Cancer

- My roles in the wet lab part were isolating RNA, making cDNA, and qPCR; for the dry lab, development of easy to use pipeline with CGC Cloud and available R packages for RNA-Seq data analysis, and data visualization.

#### Senior Project and Internships


##### Investigation of allergen specific immunotherapy on patients with bee-venom allergy

- I experienced PBMC isolation (2015 - Fall, Bilkent University, Turkey - Supervisor: Ihsan GURSEL). 

##### The relationship between some of Mesp family genes and other known somitogenesis genes in zebrafish vertebrae development

- I did lots of in situ hybridization experiments in zebrafish embryos to study somitogenesis (2015 - Summer, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY, USA - Supersivor: Ertugrul Ozbudak).
