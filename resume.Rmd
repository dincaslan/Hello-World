Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NUS Research Scholar

(Currently) Biomedical Engineering, NUS

Singapore

2019-2023

- Development of single cell high throughput assays/protocols.

### Master Student

Molecular Biology and Genetics, Bilkent University

Ankara, Turkey

2016 - 2019

#### Tissue Specific Transcriptome of Zebrafish in AChE Mutant Embryos

- I analyzed tissue specificity (TS) of zebrafish, considering the dynamicity of gene expression, by using specific metrics such as Tau, Tsi. Then I applied the TS analysis on the mutant zebrafish embryos by using the publicly available datasets. I compared the effect of using different normalization methods on TS discovery as well. I performed qPCRs for in vivo confirmations after isolating the RNAs. I further investigated the relationship between ache and the retinal genes by using the tools like Gene Onthology (GO).

#### Role of AChE as a tumor suppressor together with P53

- My role was to bred appropriate zebrafish lines dissect, genotype the fish tissues and embed them in OCT.

#### Identification of peridodontis disease related genes (collaboration w/Dentistry Department of Ankara University)

- I assisted the dentistry students to perform both wet lab and bioinformatics analysis.

#### Role of Mineralocorticoid Receptor in Breast Cancer

- My roles in the wet lab part were RNA isolation and qPCR; for the dry lab, development of easy to use pipeline with Seven Bridges CGC and available R packages for RNA-Seq data analysis, and data visualization.

### Investigation of allergen specific immunotherapy on patients with bee-venom allergy

Bilkent University - Supervisor: Ihsan GURSEL 

Ankara, Turkey

2015 Fall

- I experienced PBMC isolation

###  The relationship between some of Mesp family genes and other known somitogenesis genes in zebrafish vertebrae development

Albert Einstein College of Medicine - Supersivor: Ertugrul Ozbudak

NY, USA

2015 Summer

- I did lots of in situ hybridization experiments with zebrafish embryos to study somitogenesis.
