Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NUS Research Scholar (Currently)

Biomedical Engineering, NUS (Supervisor: Lih Feng CHEOW)

Singapore

2019-2023

- Development of single cell high throughput assays/protocols for 1) total RNA sequencing and 2) multiomics profiling of secreting cells.

### Master Student

MBG, Bilkent University (Supervisor: Ozlen KONU)

Ankara, Turkey

2016 - 2019

#### Tissue Specific Transcriptome of Zebrafish in AChE Mutant Embryos

- I analyzed tissue specificity (TS) of zebrafish, considering the dynamicity of gene expression, by using specific metrics such as Tau, Tsi. I compared the outcome of different normalization methods on TS discovery as well. Then I applied the TS analysis on publicly available mutant zebrafish embryos datasets. I performed qPCRs for in vivo confirmations after isolating the RNAs. I further investigated the relationship between ache and the retinal genes by using the tools like Gene Onthology (GO).

#### Role of AChE as a tumor suppressor together with p53

- My role was to bred appropriate zebrafish lines, dissect, genotype the fish tissues and embed them in OCT.

#### Identification of peridodontis disease related genes (collaboration w/Dentistry Department of Ankara University)

- I assisted the dentistry students.

#### Role of mineralocorticoid receptor in breast cancer

- My roles in the wet lab part were RNA isolation and qPCR; for the dry lab, making a pipeline with Seven Bridges CGC and available R packages for RNA-Seq data analysis, and data visualization.
