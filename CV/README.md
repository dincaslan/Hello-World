I have been using pagedown since it was introuduced by [Yihui to R community in 2018](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown). 

I have been enjoying using it for 5 years. 

I try to update my CV every year. 

I will be sharing my updated pagedown CVs here.

If you are pagedownholic for CV/resumes, please feel free to check it out!
