Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NUS Research Scholar (Thesis Submitted)

Biomedical Eng., NUS (Supervisor: Lih Feng CHEOW)

Singapore

2019 - 2023

#### High-Throughput Total RNA-Sequencing of Single Cells

<p align="justify"> My PhD project was about the development of single cell high-throughput assay for total RNA sequencing, which could be easily applied on popular platforms like 10X Chromium. Later, I created a pipeline for total RNA-seq data analysis using open-source tools. I validated the assay on different cell lines and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). 

#### High-Throughput Profiling of Secreting Single Cells

<p align="justify"> In this side project, we aimed to develop an assay to profile secreting vs. non-secreting cells of pancreatic islets upon certain stimuli. (Not Completed) </p>

### Master's Student

MBG, Bilkent University (Supervisor: Ozlen KONU)

Ankara, Turkey

2016 - 2019

#### [Tissue Specific Transcriptome of Zebrafish in AChE Mutant Embryos](https://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/server/api/core/bitstreams/70b878d8-1ae2-47c9-8bdb-39268235f392/content)

<p align="justify"> I analyzed tissue specificity (TS) of zebrafish, considering the dynamicity of gene expression, using specific metrics such as Tau, Tsi. Furthermore, I compared the outcome of different normalization methods on TS discovery. Then, I applied the TS analysis on publicly available datasets of mutant zebrafish embryos. I performed qPCRs for in vivo confirmations after isolating RNA of model zebrafish embryos. I further investigated the relationship between ache and the retinal genes by using the tools like Gene Onthology (GO).  </p>

#### Role of mineralocorticoid receptor in breast cancer

<p align="justify"> My roles in the wet lab part were RNA isolation and qPCR; for the dry lab, making a pipeline with Seven Bridges CGC and available R packages for RNA-Seq data analysis, and data visualization.  </p>

::: aside

- #### Highlights

<p align="justify"> I learnt the basics of programming during the undergrad years. Then, I used R for differential gene expression (DEG) analysis of bulk RNA-seq data, and data visualization -ggplot- during the grad school. Moreover, I learnt how to use linux/ubuntu server, and command line tools for data analysis during PhD. </p>
